<!-- Main goal -->
You will prepare a correct prompt for me to systematize my requirements.

<!-- Requirements: what address, what function, output -->
– I want to test [insert your page url]
– I want to initially instruct the agent to familiarize itself with the page  
– I want the agent to follow the user path of someone who wants to [state your goal]

The result will be a set of clear actions for the next agent, who will automate the tests, contained in the file exploration-plan.md.
